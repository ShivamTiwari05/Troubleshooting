****Initial Observation****

On deploying Prometheus with Helm, some pods were stuck in Pending:  
```
kubectl get pods -n prometheus
```

Output:  
```
prometheus-alertmanager-0                  0/1     Pending
prometheus-server-b48bbcb5c-p7nqp          0/2     Pending
```

üîç Investigation Steps  
‚úÖ 1. Checked PVCs  
```
kubectl get pvc -n prometheus
```  
Output:  
```
prometheus-server                   Pending
storage-prometheus-alertmanager-0  Pending
```  

‚úÖ 2. Described PVCs to View Events  
```
kubectl describe pvc prometheus-server -n prometheus
```

****Error observed:****

failed to provision volume with StorageClass "gp2": rpc error:
AccessDenied: Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity

‚ùå***Root Cause (Two Parts)*** 
üõë****1. Missing EBS CSI Driver Add-on****

The AWS EBS CSI driver was not installed in the cluster initially. This is required to handle dynamic EBS volume provisioning.
üõë 2. ****Misconfigured IRSA (IAM Role for Service Account)****  

Even after installing the EBS CSI driver, IRSA failed due to:  

    The trust policy had an invalid sub:  

    "system:serviceaccount:prometheus:*"  ‚ùå (wildcards not allowed)  

    The EBS CSI controller runs in kube-system, not prometheus.  
  
‚úÖ Resolution Steps  
1. üîß Installed AWS EBS CSI Driver  

Installed the add-on using:  
```
eksctl create addon \
  --name aws-ebs-csi-driver \
  --cluster <your-cluster-name> \
  --service-account-role-arn arn:aws:iam::647187953046:role/<EBS_CSI_IAM_ROLE> \
  --force
```
    This enabled the CSI controller to handle EBS volume provisioning.

2. üõ†Ô∏è Created Proper Service Account  

In namespace kube-system:  
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: ebs-csi-controller-sa
  namespace: kube-system
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::647187953046:role/<EBS_CSI_IAM_ROLE>
```
3. ‚úÖ Fixed Trust Policy on IAM Role  

Updated the IAM Role trust policy to match the actual service account:  
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::647187953046:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/id/7344D22ED59064F8EA97532181474C2E"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "oidc.eks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/id/7344D22ED59064F8EA97532181474C2E:sub": "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:ebs-csi-controller-sa",
          "oidc.eks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/id/7344D22ED59064F8EA97532181474C2E:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```  
4. üîÑ Restarted EBS CSI Controller  
```
kubectl rollout restart deployment ebs-csi-controller -n kube-system
```

5. üì¶ PVCs Successfully Bound  
  
PVCs for Prometheus were automatically retried and successfully bound to dynamically provisioned EBS volumes.  
```
kubectl get pvc -n prometheus
```

Output:  
```
prometheus-server                   Bound
storage-prometheus-alertmanager-0  Bound
```
  
‚úÖ Final Outcome  
  
    ‚úÖ AWS EBS CSI driver was installed and properly configured.  
  
    ‚úÖ IAM trust policy and IRSA were fixed.  
  
    ‚úÖ Prometheus PVCs successfully bound to EBS volumes.  
  
    ‚úÖ Pending pods moved to Running.
